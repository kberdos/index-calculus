# An Exploration of the Index Calculus
This expository work investigates the Index Calculus, a strategy to break simple cryptographic systems. We present a program to break small cases of the Discrete Log Problem over finite fields. In the paper, we prove the methods employed and share findings and insights. 

This repository contains the following 
- a `code/` directory which contains a [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) program to crack the DLP
- a `paper/` directory which contains a PDF of the paper all the resources to compile it with LaTeX. Instructions on how to run the code can be found at the end of the paper
